1. Unzip the compressed file into a folder.

The shell will interpret the following internal commands:

exit: exit shell
pwd: gives your current working directory
history: returns previous 10 commands
cd <path>: changes directory to <path>

The shell will interpret most external linux commands. 
The shell will also perform piping multiple commands:

i.e.  ping google.com|grep -i bytes

ping passes data stream to grep which parses string stream containing the word 'bytes'.
